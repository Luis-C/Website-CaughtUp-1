								<h3>What is CaughtUp?</h3>
								<p>This is a cross platform mobile application. The problem we are solving is that it is frustrating planning meetups with other people. There's miscommunication, no communication, or a lot of back and forth texting. From the Bureau of Labor Statistics, full time university/college students have 4 hours of free time on a weekday. From our personal survey regarding free time (flexible time) 70 percent of people prefer spending their free time with other people regardless of the activity.</p>
								<p>The solution to frustrations of planning hangouts is an Application that houses people’s free time. Imagine you just got out of class and you find out that you have some free time. So, you pull out your phone and you can quickly see people who you want to hangout with, who also have free time the same time you do. You contact someone, and in a few minutes you're hanging out, getting to know each other in person.
								Competitors such as Doodle Poll are more focused on specific events in the future. Other competitors such as Tinder and NAU app are focused on getting you with strangers with similar interests.
								Skipping the underlying magic behind this mobile application.</p>
								<p>The target of this application are university students because we have varying schedules and we want to meet people and make meaningful connections. We plan on reaching our target audience by promoting promotional multimedia content we create, because we have skill, over the internet. We also intend to have flyers at universities. From there we hope that the application will spread by word of mouth because those invested in the application will want to meetup with those that do not have the application.</p>
								<p>This application is becoming a reality really fast and are looking at a January 1, 2018 public beta release on Android and iOS. Beta does not necessarily mean that the program is unreliable. The purpose of beta is to catch bugs we don’t know about. The launch of the version 1.0 production application is expected to be sometime January.
								We need money to maintain the application and servers, to pay for physical marketing material, hire professional help to look over code.</p>

							<p>Advertisement revenue is S***. But, the subscription model
								of a dollar per month to remove advertisements and premium
								functionality is profitable.</p>
