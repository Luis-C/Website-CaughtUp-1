								<h3>What is CaughtUp?</h3>
								<p>
									CaughtUp is a mobile application designed to make scheduling meetings with your friends easier. <br>
									More specifically, CaughtUp is a messaging and scheduling app that allows you to share
									your flexible time with friends so they know when you can and want to hangout.
									Take out the guessing of when a friend wants to hangout or when a friend is available.
								</p>
								<h3>Why should I use CaughtUp?</h3>
								<p>
									Making plans takes time. And when you have to worry about your
									job or school sometimes it just isn't very appealing to sit down
									for minutes (maybe even hours) trying to find that perfect timeslot
									were all your friends are available. “I’m free Monday, let’s hangout!”
									“Sorry, I’m busy Monday. Can you do Friday?” “Well, I can’t do Friday,
									what about Sunday?” “I’m available Sunday but only from 3 to 4.”
									We’ve all been there, and it’s frustrating. Especially when you
									find out all of your friends had Wednesday available, but it
									just never came up in the conversation.
								</p>
								<p>
									CaughtUp is here to fix that. You just have to let it know
									when you want to “catch up” and we’ll make sure your friends
									know you’re available. Don’t lose out on great memories and
									keep your friends face to face.
								</p>

								<h3>Why wouldn’t I just use [insert some name here]?</h3>
								<p>
									Competitors tend to focus too much on long term planning.
									Which completely ignores the magic of spontaneous meetings.
									Or focus on other goals such as dating. We operate under
									the belief that we all have busy schedules, but that shouldn’t
									be an excuse to miss out on great memories. We want you to keep
									up your busy and productive life, but still have the opportunity
									to keep your friends face to face.
								</p>

								<h3>How do I view my friend's flexible time?</h3>
								<p>
									Click on their profile picture in while in the friends home page.
								</p>

								<h3>How do I share my flexible time with friends?</h3>
								<p>
									Add an event in the Schedule page and your friends will be able
									to see that you have free time. You can also add information such
									what you want to do (Hangout, Eat, Exercise, or Not Sure) and
									a note for additional information.
								</p>

								<h3>Is CaughtUp free?</h3>
								<p>
									Yes, you can enjoy our app without having to spend a penny.
								</p>

								<h3>How do I invite my friends to download CaughtUp?</h3>
								<p>
									Share this website with them. On the application you can share
									CaughtUp my pressing the share button.
								</p>
