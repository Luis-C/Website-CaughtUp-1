					<h3>About CaughtUp</h3>
					<p>The problem we are trying to solve is that planning meetups can be frustrating. There's miscommunication, no communication, or a lot of back and forth texting. From the Bureau of Labor Statistics, full time university/college students have 4 hours of free time on a weekday. From our personal research 70 percent of people prefer spending their free time with other people regardless of the activity. </p>
					<p>Our solution is an Application that houses people’s free time. Imagine you just finished your busy schedule and want to hang out. You just simply pull out your phone and you can quickly see which of your friends have matching free time. With the press of a button you send them an invitation and voila! If multiple people send and accept an invitation the app automatically groups you together.</p>
					<h3>About Our philosophy</h3>
					<p>As busy college students we noticed that people start to drift away. And we asked ourselves, what’s the point of a friend list with a 1000+ people, if you’ll never even see half of them in person?</p>
					<p>We are here to help you gain and maintain more meaningful relationships. Our motto is “keep your friends face to face” because we believe that in the modern era it’s a little too easy to stay behind a screen.</p>
					<h3>About the Team</h3>
					<p>We believe a team is made up of hackers (those that make the product), designers (work on the image of the product), and hustlers (those that plan and move the project forward). You can count on the CaughtUp team to deliver. Stephen Tan has experience developing mobile applications and creating promotional multimedia content. Just lookup “Stephen Tan Parkour” on YouTube. Kirby Emerson is an Industrial Design Major who helped out with the initial designs of the mobile application. Luis Carbrera is an artist, made the first logo, and is studying computer science.</p>
