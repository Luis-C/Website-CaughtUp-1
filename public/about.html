					<h3>Once Upon A Time</h3>
					<p>
						Stephen Tan, the company’s founder, woke up one day and discovered
						that he had no friends. Well, none that could hang out with him. His
						regular friends were either busy or didn't reply. <br>
						So he gave up. <br>
						And he started writing the CaughtUp app. <br>
						Everyday, it seems that the stars and the heavens need to align for
						people to meet up. It doesn’t have to be this way. <br>
						Today, the CaughtUp team is preparing to launch their android and ios app in March.
					</p>

					<h3>About CaughtUp</h3>

					<p>The problem we are trying to solve is that planning meetups can be frustrating.
						There's miscommunication, no communication, or a lot of back and forth texting.
						From the Bureau of Labor Statistics, full time university/college students have
						4 hours of free time on a weekday. From our personal research 70 percent of people
						prefer spending their free time with other people regardless of the activity.
					</p>
					<p>Our solution is an Application that houses people’s free time.
						Imagine you just finished your busy schedule and want to hang out.
						You just simply pull out your phone and you can quickly see which of
						your friends have matching free time. With the press of a button you
						send them an invitation and voila! If multiple people send and accept
						an invitation the app automatically groups you together.
					</p>
					<h3>About Our Philosophy</h3>
					<p>As busy college students we noticed that people start to drift away.
						And we asked ourselves, what’s the point of a friend list with a
						100+ people, if you’ll never even see half of them in person?
					</p>
					<p>CaughtUp will help you gain and maintain more meaningful relationships.
						Our motto is “keep your friends face to face” because we believe
						that in the modern era it’s a little too easy to stay behind a screen
						and miss out on living the moments.
					</p>
					<h3>About Transparency</h3>
					<p>
						We are a transparent company and will share almost EVERYTHING with you. We have learned a lot
						from developing our business and are open to sharing our lessons with you. We do not see why
						good lessons should go to waste. Ask us anything.
					</p>
					<h3>Special Thanks</h3>
					<p>
						These are the people that in one way or another have helped us throughout our journey.
						We have learned a lot from you and won't be where we are today without you.
